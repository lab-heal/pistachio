# PISTACHIo 2.0 (PreemptIon of diSrupTive behAvior in CHIldren)

Model training and analysis code for PISTACHIo 2.0.

PISTACHIo 2.0 is a machine learning application that uses physiological biomarkers, including heart rate and sleep quality, collected by wearables, such as smartwatches, to predict disruptive behavior in children.

Predicting such behavior in children 4 to 10 years old —- before it manifests with disruptive behavior disorder, autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder —- allows parents time to seek help. It provides a window to learn about and start using therapeutic parenting practices, such as parent-child interaction therapy.
